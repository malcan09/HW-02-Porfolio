            <p class="col-9"> I was born in Tijuana, Mexico on February 17th 1995. I grew up there until I moved to San
                Diego, California at the age of 13 in 2008. I attended Point loma High School all 4 years before moving
                to Boston, Massachussets to continue my college education.
                At the University of Massachussets, Boston I studied Social Psychology and Spanish Literature.Also, I
                was part of the soccer team all 4 years, being captain my senior year.
                I am currently working for a furniture company call Nativa Interiors.I decided to take this BootCamp in
                order to seek a new career and more benefits in my future for a better job. Thus far, this program has
                been an absolute challenge. It's been hard trying to manage a full time job while trying to keep up with
                code work. Putting a lot of time practicing coding is very essential, so I'm hoping I can find a way for
                balance even if that means sacrificing other hobbies of mine, like soccer.But, I am surprised at how
                quick the course it's moving. I could only imagine how bad the full time option is.</p>
